I am a software engineer based in London, currently working for a US-based email and cloud security scale-up, Abnormal Security. Before that, I was working for Monzo and ESET.

This blog is a mix of multiple different topics. I write mostly about [software engineering related](/tech/) topics, ranging from distirbuted systems, networking, to delving into concrete programming problems in different languages (C++, Go, Python). Additionalyl, I write [explorations](/explorations) where I try to research and understand different areas of contemporary economies and societies. Lastly, I sometimes write [personal essays](/essays/) completely unrelated to my work.
