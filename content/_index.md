I am a software engineer based in London, currently working for the US-based email and cloud security scale-up, Abnormal Security. Previously, I worked at Monzo and ESET.

This blog covers a variety of topics. I primarily write about [software engineering](/tech/), from distributed systems and networking to deep dives into concrete programming challenges in languages like C++, Go, and Python. I also explore different areas of [contemporary economies and societies](/explorations), researching and analyzing topics that spark my curiosity. Occasionally, I share [personal essays](/essays) that are completely unrelated to my professional work.
