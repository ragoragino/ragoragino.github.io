I am a software engineer based in London, currently working for a US-based email and cloud security scale-up, Abnormal Security. Before that, I was working for Monzo and ESET.

This blog is a mix of multiple different topics. On one axis are my [general blog topics](/tech/) revolving mostly around C++, Go, distributed systems and networking. In addition, I sometimes write [essays](/essays/) completely unrelated to my work.
