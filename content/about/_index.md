I am a software engineer based in London, currently working for a US-based email and cloud security scale-up, Abnormal Security. Before that, I was working for Monzo and ESET. My resume can be found {{< staticfile >}}here{{< /staticfile >}}.

This blog is a mix of multiple different topics. On one axis are my [general blog topics](/tech/) revolving mostly around C++, Go, distributed systems and networking. In addition, I sometimes write [essays](/essays/) completely unrelated to my work.

Even though I am a software engineer, I have formal education in history and quantitative economics. However, along the way, I somehow got swayed by computers and software. Nonetheless, I am still very interested in history (being a huge fan of the Annales school of historical analysis), and also in economics (mainly macro-related stuff). My software engineering expertise is in the realms of security, networking, big data and distributed systems.
