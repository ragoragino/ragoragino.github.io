If you got here, you got probably lost on your adventures on the internet or you are one of my friends whom I forced to check out my blog!

In the former case, you probably don't know me that well, so let me introduce myself very shortly.

I have a formal education in history and quantitative economics. However, along the way, I somehow got swayed by computers and software. However, I am still very interested in history (being a huge fan of the Annales school of historical analysis, check them out!), and also in economics (although not having any specific school of analysis that I am that fond of). Currently, I am working as a software engineer mainly in the realm of cloud-native development. I am very much in love with distributed systems, operating systems, and networking.

Besides doing computer stuff and reading in my free time, I enjoy Zen meditation, learning new languages, watching movies (particularly B movies) and visiting movie festivals.

I think that is more or less all.

So, if you belong to the group of people that got lost here, I recommend to head over to some more reputables pages, this place can get pretty dangerous! In case you are my friend that was forced to read all of this, thanks!

PS: The title of the blog is a reference to the movie In the Mood for Love from 2000 by Wong Kar-wai from Hong Kong. Great movie!
